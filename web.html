                <p>I find it extremely ironic that I'm a writer. As a child, I barely spoke. My gaze stayed glued to the floor, hiding behind the bangs that covered my eyes. I never touched a book willing, I actively avoided them in fact. I don't remember a single thing I read in elementary school except the Bone graphic novel series. I remember I didn't know how to pronounce quiche correctly, but don't remember the nature of my mispronunciation. I didn't read or write a single thing for myself until middle school, which can entirely be credited to two wonderful teachers I had during that time, Miss Brigham, my ELA AIS teacher, and Mrs. Nedwell, my 7th grade homeroom teacher.</p>
                
                <p>They were the first teachers I felt ever really saw me, how much I had to say, but didn't know how to say it. They were the ones who put books in my hands that inspired me, works like the Arc of a Scythe series by Neal Shusterman, Orbiting Jupiter by Gary D. Schmidt. They were the ones who bought me my first writing journal, the ones who read every awful poem and sad story I wove together over the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and extra cheddar goldfish I'd eat in their classrooms. They are the ones I have to thank for my love of writing.</p>
                
                <p>When I applied as a creative writing major at SUNY Plattsburgh, I had no clue what I was doing, or what I planned to do with my degree. My father was definitely nervous about my prospects after college, especially considering I'd be entering a field actively being overtaken by AI. It wasn't until my fourth semester that I really found my direction. I was lucky enough to take an Editing and Publishing course with one of my favorite professors at Platts, Sara Schaff, in which I got to work on an internationally reviewed, digitally published literary magazine that was affiliated with the college, the Saranac Review. It was during my time in that class that I fostered a love for publishing and the helping others refine their works. I planned until very recently to dedicate my career to exactly that: find an internship in publishing, preferably of books, but a literary magazine would be great too—anything but the news; work as an editor, rise in the ranks and earn a salary that can support the nuclear family my fiancee and I planned to have; provide the lifestyle and freedom my father was able to provide for me and my family, preferably from the warm comfort of my future home office with a fully digital position. I'd be fine working in person too, but publishing jobs in the Saratoga County area are far and few between.</p>
                
                <p>That was my plan until this fall semester, the second to last semester of my bachelors degree, where I became afflicted with the sublime and trepidacious idea of going to graduate school for creative writing out in Boston. In a conversation with my anthropology professor, Justin, I learned that to teach collegiately you don't actually need a degree in education. All you need is a masters degree. While I'm still debating whether or not I want to teach, the idea of being able to remind future generations of the freedom and beauty that is obtained through writing, of the miraculous and evergrowing variety of literature that has endured, prospered, and changed throughout time; to give students who are growing up in a technological age that's moving at lightning speed a moment of rest and reflection, a moment to ponder the thoughts and intentions of modern and classic romantics like Robert Frost and Samuel T. Coleridge; to help them explore their own perspectives and writing talents; to be the catalyst for someone like Miss Brigham and Mrs. Nedwell were for me—all of that doesn't sound too bad.</p>
